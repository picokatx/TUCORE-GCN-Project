Developing 2 branches of TUCORE-GCN
1. Parity Branch: 1-1 code implementations
2. Opinionated Branch: Seeks to improve infrastructure of the original work, while maintaining parity to a reasonable degree
Current codebase is a mesh between the 2

Rigorous testing of code needed

Roberta Implementation should have seperate tokenizer+datasetgenerator for now
