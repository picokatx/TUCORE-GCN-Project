Some weights of LlamaForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at BlackSamorez/TinyLlama-1_1B-Chat-v1_0-AQLM-2Bit-1x16-hf and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
